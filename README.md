### Project Title
Data Structure Problems

### Description
In this project, I tackled six problems related to data structures: LRU Cache, File Recursion, Huffman Coding, Active Directory, Blockchain, and Union and Intersection. For each problem, I wrote efficient Python code and provided explanations of my design choices and code efficiency.

### The project includes:

* Implementing an LRU Cache for efficient data retrieval
* Recursively finding files in a directory
* Compressing data using Huffman Coding
* Creating a structure for Active Directory user lookups
* Building a simple Blockchain with linked list implementation
* Finding the union and intersection of two linked lists

### Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1)
Libraries used in the program:
* OrderedDict from collections
* os
* sys
* Counter from collections
* deque from collections
* hashlib
* time
