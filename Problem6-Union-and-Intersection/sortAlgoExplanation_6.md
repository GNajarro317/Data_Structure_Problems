Task
The task is to implement two functions to find the union and intersection of two linked lists.

Explanation
Union function combines two linked lists and removes duplicates and the Intersection function finds the common elements between two linked lists.
Both utilize the set method as it allows for elements to be added and removed from the list based on the node values being seen.

The time complexity of the union and intersection functions is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both linked lists. 
his is because we iterate through each element in both linked lists once to perform the union and intersection operations.
